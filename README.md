# Inventory Management System
The Inventory Management System is a Python-based application that allows you to manage your product inventory. It connects to a MongoDB database (specifically, MongoDB Cloud or MongogDB Atlas) and provides functionalities such as adding products, deleting products, displaying the inventory, searching for products, updating quantities, generating reports, and identifying low-stock products.
